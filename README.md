# Quantum Topology Optimization via Quantum Annealing


Implementation of the paper (Zisheng Ye et. al, [2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10099425)).

[gbd_classical.m](./gbd_classical.m) gives a classical implementation example of the Generalized Benders' Decomposition based algorithm for the minimum compliance problem.

[gbd_classical_split.m](./gbd_classical_split.m) gives a classical implementation example of the algorithm working with the splitting approach for the minimum compliance problem.

[gbd_quantum.m](./gbd_quantum.m) gives a implementation example of the algorithm with access to D-Wave's quantum annealer for the minimum compliance problem.
